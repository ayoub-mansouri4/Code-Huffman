*   A minimal variable-length character coding based on the frequency of each one. First, each character becomes a one-node binary tree, with the character as the only node. The character's frequency is the tree's frequency. Next, two trees with the minor frequencies are joined as the subtrees of a new root assigned to the sum of their frequencies. Repeat until all characters are in one tree. One code bit represents each level. Thus more recurring characters are near the root and are coded with few bits, and rare characters are far from the root and are coded with many bits.
